Jalli - an opensource chatlog converter

Features

Supported messengers: mcabber, Empathy, Pidgin
Multiple input files. So its easy to convert a dozen log files with one command.
Easy to use. Only small dialogs. And a classical command style.
Easy to expand. There is an easy scheme for developers to add other messengers.
