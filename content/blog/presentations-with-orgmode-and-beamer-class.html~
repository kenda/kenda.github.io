I just wanted to share my happiness about a new workflow for writing presentations. I couldn’t believe how quick I got useful slides by writing my notes with Emacs’ [Orgmode](http://orgmode.org/). So, here it is:

1. Do some research or brainstorming or whatever and take notes with Orgmode
2. Do a little cleanup on the structure of your notes so that you get a useful [structure](http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-beamer/tutorial.html#sec-3) of your slides
3. [Export](http://orgmode.org/manual/Exporting.html) your notes with the LaTeX [Beamer class](https://bitbucket.org/rivanvx/beamer/)  
    - You may have to append the defintion for beamer class to org-export-latex-classes. Here is [my](https://gist.github.com/1324351) definition.

That’s it!
This means you don’t waste any time with creating your slides and you can concentrate 100% on the content. I’m sure that’s (even more) faster than writing pure LaTeX and faster, nicer, … than [Open|Libre]Office/PPT anyway. Don’t know what to do with the whole time, but thanks Orgmode! :)
