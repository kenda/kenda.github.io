<p>
After months, I finally got my Emacs config published. It is now available on <a href="https://github.com/kenda/.emacs.d">Github</a>. So check out the <a href="https://github.com/kenda/.emacs.d/blob/master/config.org">config.org</a> file for the main configuration. If you found interesting parts or ideas for improvements - just leave a comment below :)
