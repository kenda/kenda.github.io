<p>
Although I try to avoid to use word processors like LibreOffice Writer, sometimes   - mainly for collaboration purposes - I have to fall back on them. And in such hard
times I want to have at least some useful keybindings. Because I couldn't find any downloads that provide Emacs bindings for OpenOffice/LibreOffice Writer
I configured the basic bindings which you can download <a href="../../media/files/writer_bindings_emacs.zip">here</a>.

<p>
Currently supported/implemented bindings are:
</p><table class="table table-condensed table-striped table-bordered" border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" rules="groups" frame="hsides">
<caption></caption>
<colgroup><col class="left" /><col class="left" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr><th scope="col" class="left">Binding</th><th scope="col" class="left">Function</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td class="left">C-f</td><td class="left">forward-char</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">C-b</td><td class="left">backward-char</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">C-n</td><td class="left">next-line</td></tr>
<tr><td class="left">C-p</td><td class="left">previous-line</td></tr>

Maybe the supported bindings grow from time to time. But as a starting point these are my personally most often used basic keybindings.
