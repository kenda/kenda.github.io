Although I try to avoid to use word processors like LibreOffice Writer, sometimes   - mainly for collaboration purposes - I have to fall back on them. And in such hard
times I want to have at least some useful keybindings. Because I couldn't find any downloads that provide Emacs bindings for OpenOffice/LibreOffice Writer
I configured the basic bindings which you can download [[../../media/files/writer_bindings_emacs.zip][here]].

Currently supported/implemented bindings are:
|-------------+--------------------|
| Binding     | Function           |
|-------------+--------------------|
| C-f         | forward-char       |
| C-b         | backward-char      |
| C-n         | next-line          |
| C-p         | previous-line      |
| M-f         | forward-word       |
| M-b         | backward-word      |
| C-v         | next page          |
| M-v         | previous page      |
| C-a         | beginning-of-line  |
| C-e         | end-of-line        |
|-------------+--------------------|
| C-k         | kill-line          |
| M-d         | kill-word          |
| M-backspace | backward-kill-word |
|-------------+--------------------|

To load the archive go to Tools \rightarrow Customize \rightarrow Keyboard \rightarrow Load...

Maybe the supported bindings grow from time to time. But as a starting point these are my personally most often used basic keybindings.

Feel free to add your own ones and let me know it.
