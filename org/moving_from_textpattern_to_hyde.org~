This post is about my switch from [[http://textpattern.org][Textpattern]] to [[http://hyde.github.com/][Hyde]] as my website system (some call it CMS thought).

In the past I tried a few systems, starting with [[http://wordpress.org][Wordpress]], then [[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki][MediaWiki]] and then Textpattern. The reasons for this
changes were mostly the extensibility of the systems and the way you write articles/posts etc. Until the next switch I think
I'm happy with Hyde :)

** Textpattern
What I really liked about Textpattern is the way you can customize the structure of your website. You can freely define
serveral ?Textbausteine? which are some kind of shortcuts for often used ?Ausdr√ºcke?, like a header, menu or footer. 
Because it is so easy to extend the structure it was very easy for me to implement [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa][RDFa]]. Nevertheless I felt Textpattern
is a bit moldy and I couldn't really cotton up with [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_(markup_language)][Textile]], but that's 100% subjective.

** Hyde

*** Orgmode and Hyde
