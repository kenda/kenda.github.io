After months, I finally got my Emacs config published. It is now available on [[https://github.com/kenda/.emacs.d][Github]]. So check out the [[https://github.com/kenda/.emacs.d/blob/master/config.org][config.org]] file for the main configuration. If you found interesting parts or ideas for improvements - just leave a comment below :)
